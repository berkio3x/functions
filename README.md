# functions

## Sin (x)
- periodic function with period of 2 pi
  - for any x , sin(x) = sin(x + 2 * M_PI) 
 - Intuition behind sin waves (ex. from unit circles).
 - Increase frequency of waves . modify paramter of x in sin(x).
 - Increrase amplitude of waves . modify final output of sin (x).

### cos(X)
- Cosine is just like Sine, but it starts at 1 and heads down until π radians (180°) and then heads up again.

\[ f\left(x\right) = \sin\left(0.4x + T\right) + 0.2 \cos\left(2x + 2T\right) \]




## Mirror a curve along y axis. mod function. |x|



## Step function.  floor(x)

## slowly growing y with x . log(x)
